# perl commands to use right on the command line

# separate decimals from integers to avoid confusion by perl 
# example: confusing 1  2.5 as ’12.5’ in perl’s mind

perl -pi.bak -we 's/ 2.5/\n2.5/g' newSum.txt

# eliminating extra space by 3.5 to avoid processing errors
# blank spaces causes issues in bash/open source code

perl -pi.bak -we 's/ *3.5/3.5/g' newSum.txt

# eliminating extra space between 1 and 6
# to avoid confusing ‘1   6’ as 16
perl -pi.bak -we 's/6/\n6/g' newSum.txt
