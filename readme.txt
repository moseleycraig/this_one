Problem 1

Here are notes on the scripts I used. The first (script_1) is a bash script to consolidate individual files to one text file that will be easier to process. I then used three perl command line scripts (script_2_perl) to separate decimals from integers, eliminate extra space to avoid processing errors and eliminate extra spaces between numbers to avoid confusing ‘1   6’ as 16 and change the mean outcome. Once those tasks were complete I then used an AWK script (script_3) to calculate the mean. The final output is in the newSum.txt file.

Problem 2

The final output is a file named DBAN.docx (MS Word file).
